#Purpose:
        This script automates the installation and configuration of essential services (Apache HTTP Server, MySQL Server, and phpMyAdmin) on a Linux system.

#Instructions:
        Run the script in a Bash shell environment.
        When prompted, enter the name of the service you want to install (e.g., httpd, mysql-server, or phpmyadmin).
        Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process.

#Notes:
        Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to execute the script and install packages.
        Review the output for any error messages or warnings during the installation process.
        Consider the security implications of temporarily disabling SELinux enforcement (setenforce 0) and opening ports in the firewall without proper configuration.
